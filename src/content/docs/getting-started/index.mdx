# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your TinyDocs documentation site.

## Installation

1. Use this template to create a new repository
2. Clone your repository
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Project Structure

TinyDocs uses a simple directory structure:

```
src/content/
├── index.mdx              # Launch page
└── docs/
    ├── intro/
    │   └── index.mdx      # Introduction
    └── getting-started/
        └── index.mdx      # This page
```

## Creating Documentation

Create new documentation pages by adding MDX files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. You can organize them into subdirectories to create collapsible sections in the sidebar.

### Frontmatter

Each documentation page should include frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Page description
order: 1
---
```

- `title`: The page title (required)
- `description`: A brief description (optional)
- `order`: Sort order within the section (optional)

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

Build your site for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Deployment

Deploy the `dist/` directory to any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
