# Configuration

Customize your TinyDocs site by editing the configuration files.

## Site Configuration

Edit `src/siteConfig.ts` to update your site's metadata:

```typescript
export const SITE = {
  title: "Your Docs",
  description: "Your documentation site description",
  href: "https://yourdocs.com/",
  author: "Your Name",
  locale: "en-US",
};
```

## Navigation Links

Update the navigation links in the same file:

```typescript
export const NAV_LINKS = {
  docs: {
    path: "/docs",
    label: "Docs",
  },
  about: {
    path: "/about",
    label: "About",
  },
};
```

## Social Links

Configure your social media links:

```typescript
export const SOCIAL_LINKS = [
  {
    label: "GitHub",
    href: "https://github.com/yourusername",
  },
  // Add more links as needed
];
```
