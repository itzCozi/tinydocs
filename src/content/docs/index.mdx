## Key Features

- **Minimal and fast:** Built with Astro for optimal performance

- **Accessible:** System, dark, and light mode support with keyboard navigation
- **Developer-friendly:** TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and modern tooling

<InfoBox icon={CircleHelp} variant="info">
This is an example of the InfoBox component that you can use in your documentation.
</InfoBox>

## Getting Started

To get started with TinyDocs, check out the [Introduction](/docs/intro/) guide.

## Structure

Your documentation is organized in the `src/content/docs/` directory:

- `index.mdx` - Your main documentation page
- `intro/` - Introduction section with nested pages
- `guides/` - Guides and tutorials

Each directory can have an `index.mdx` file that serves as the landing page for that section.
