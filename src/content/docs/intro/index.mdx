# Introduction

Welcome to the TinyDocs introduction section! This guide will help you get started with building your documentation site.

## What is TinyDocs?

TinyDocs is a documentation framework that transforms the TinyBones blog template into a full-featured documentation site. It maintains all the great features of TinyBones while adding documentation-specific features like:

- Hierarchical page organization
- Sidebar navigation
- Table of contents positioning on the right
- Support for nested categories

## Quick Start

1. Create your documentation files in `src/content/docs/`
2. Organize them into categories using folders
3. Use the `order` frontmatter field to control the order of pages
4. Write your content using Markdown or MDX

## Next Steps

Continue to the [Installation Guide](/docs/intro/installation) to set up your documentation site.
